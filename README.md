# ImageFetchBot
A telegram bot to fetch images from Google

## The code for this bot has been superseded by https://github.com/bo0tzz/ImageBot-ex !

This bot lets you use Telegram's inline bot functionality to search Google images and send them in a chat!
You can find a working version of the bot on Telegram at [@ImageFetcherBot](http://t.me/imagefetcherbot),
or compile it yourself with `mvn clean package`

Makes use of the [JavaTelegramBot-API](https://github.com/zackpollard/JavaTelegramBot-API).
